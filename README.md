# Description

There are two files have been uploaded into this repository.

- homework2java.java:
  - This java file contains the java code which will calculate the final average grade and show the final grade along with comments.
  - The java code will first define five variables (grade1-5) as double.
  - Then calculate the average grade of these five grades, and print a line to show the final average grade.
  - Then it will use if..else if with below conditions to verify the final average grade, and print out final letter grade along with the comments.
    - If the final average grade is more than 90.00 and less than 100 it prints “A: Fantastic job!”
    - If it is between 80 to 89.99, it prints: “B: Good!”
    - If it is between 70 to 79.99, it prints “C: Please try more next time!”
    - If it is 69.99 or less, it prints “F: Unfortunately you failed!”
